IST-FP6-034763 QualiPSo: QualiPSo is a unique alliance
of European, Brazilian and Chinese ICT industry players,
SMEs, governments and academics to help industries and
governments fuel innovation and competitiveness with Open
Source software. To meet that goal, the QualiPSo consortium
intends to define and implement the technologies, processes
and policies to facilitate the development and use of Open
Source software components, with the same level of trust
traditionally offered by proprietary software. QualiPSo is
partially funded by the European Commission under EUï¿½s sixth
framework program (FP6), as part of the Information Society
Technologies (IST) initiative. 

This program has been created as part of the QualiPSo work
package on "Semantic Interoperability". The basic idea of this work    
package is to demonstrate how semantic technologies can be used to 
cope with the diversity and heterogeneity of software and services 
in the OSS domain.
